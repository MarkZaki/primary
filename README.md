## Current Goal
Build out a relatively simple (3 files: index.html, index.js, api.js / mysql.js) API endpoint server. Our goal is to figure out what should all commonplace API endpoints be (login,logout,updatebio,tweet,comment,like,retweet,etc...) An API endpoint is a key feature to the software we're building -- we don't need to have many, just choose a few that we really do need. Endpoints are considered completed when they can be tested via buttons on the homepage (index.html file.) To make an endpoint, you have to add it to api.js -- following the same pattern already set by other end points we already created. Make sure to come up proper names, nothing complicated, no camel case.

## Primary Social Network
Primary is a social network for every kind of person. Based on the preferences, each user gets its own view and layout of the app, perfectly adjusted to their needs.

## Motivation / Vision
Our current vision is to create an API end point server.
Our primary goal right now is to develop a complete API end point server.
General use API end points (login, register, post comment, retweet, etc) are our main goal at this time.

## Code style
We have not declared a specific code style yet.
Ask JavaScript Teacher for more information.

## Tech/framework used
This project is completely build with vanilla JavaScript and without any framework. We are looking to simplicity.

## Features
People from different areas can use the network for its own purpose. A musician for example has another view than a artist or athlete.

## Code Example
Coming soon ...

## Installation
Install dependencies using **`npm install`**. 
Then, **`database`** must be configured. To do that, go to **`modules/config/`** folder and create duplicate **`db_config.example.json`** as **`db_config.json`**.
Finally, you can enter your database credentials into **`db_config.json`**.

## API Reference
We are publishing some useful links to API references soon ...

## Tests
Coming soon ...
