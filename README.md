## Primary Social Network
Primary is a social network for every kind of person. Based on the preferences, each user gets its own view and layout of the app, perfectly adjusted to their needs.

## Motivation / Vision
Our current vision is to create an API end point server.
Our primary goal right now is to develop a complete API end point server.
General use API end points (login, register, post comment, retweet, etc) are our main goal at this time.

## Code style
We have not declared a specific code style yet.
Ask JavaScript Teacher for more information.

## Tech/framework used
This project is completely build with vanilla JavaScript and without any framework. We are looking to simplicity.

## Features
People from different areas can use the network for its own purpose. A musician for example has another view than a artist or athlete.

## Code Example
Coming soon ...

## Installation
Install dependencies using **`npm install`**. 
Then, **`database`** must be configured. To do that, go to **`modules/config/`** folder and create duplicate **`db_config.example.json`** as **`db_config.json`**.
Finally, you can enter your database credentials into **`db_config.json`**.

## API Reference
We are publishing some useful links to API references soon ...

## Tests
Coming soon ...
